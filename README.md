# Hello-world
My name is Oluwsegun Omogoye, I am a software engineer presently studying software engineering with ALX
I am a graduate of Physics from the University of Technology, Minna.
I am not a great programmer yet, but I will some day provide the best solution to the hardest problem of the world.
Thank you.
